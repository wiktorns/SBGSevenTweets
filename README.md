# SevenTweets
SevenTweets is a network of mini services that should resemble twitter. Each service that will be part of SevenTweets can 
have different implementation but will be built to support a standardised API so that the communication between services can be possible. 

Every node in SevenTweets would: 
- Be a separate service 
- Be able to work with tweets (published message) 
- Have its own identificator (username) 
- Have its own local storage for tweets originating from that node 
- Have to know addresses of all other nodes 
- Perform notifications to other nodes when starting/shutting down
